# Expandi Docker images mirror

This repository manages a mirror of some commonly-used container images which are normally hosted on a well-known
container image registry that decided to throttle pulls for non-paying users.

The images are mirrored to the GitHub Container Registry, which is free for public repositories.

The images are provided publicly solely for the purpose of not needing authentication to pull them, without any
guarantee of availability or security.

We don't recommend using these images outside our organization: we recommend you mirror them yourself.

The workflow is licensed under the MIT license and can be copied and modified freely.
